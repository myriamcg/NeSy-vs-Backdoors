# Projects using LTN
This folder contains a series of example experiments. They show how the language of Real Logic can be used to specify a number of tasks that involve learning from data and reasoning about logical knowledge. Examples of such tasks are: classification, regression, clustering, link prediction.

Below, we also highlight a list of third-party projects that use and/or extend LTN. 
If you have a project that can be added to this list, or if you want to make a correction, please create a GitHub issue sharing details about your work or reach out to [badreddine.samy@gmail.com](badreddine.samy@gmail.com).
