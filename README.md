# Logic Tensor Networks (LTN)

## Installation

Clone the LTN repository and install it using `pip install -e <local project path>`.

Following are the dependencies we used for development (similar versions should run fine):
- python 3.8
- tensorflow >= 2.2 (for running the core system)
- numpy >= 1.18 (for examples)
- matplotlib >= 3.2 (for examples)

## Repository structure

- `logictensornetworks/core.py` -- core system for defining constants, variables, predicates, functions and formulas,
- `logictensornetworks/fuzzy_ops.py` -- a collection of fuzzy logic operators defined using Tensorflow primitives,
- `logictensornetworks/utils.py` -- a collection of useful functions,
- `tutorials/` -- tutorials to start with LTN,
- `examples/` -- various problems approached using LTN,
- `tests/` -- tests.

## Getting Started

### Tutorials

`tutorials/` contains a walk-through of LTN. In order, the tutorials cover the following topics:
1. [Grounding in LTN part 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/master/tutorials/1-grounding_non_logical_symbols.ipynb): Real Logic, constants, predicates, functions, variables,
2. [Grounding in LTN part 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/master/tutorials/2-grounding_connectives.ipynb): connectives and quantifiers (+ [complement](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/master/tutorials/2b-operators_and_gradients.ipynb): choosing appropriate operators for learning),
3. [Learning in LTN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/master/tutorials/3-knowledgebase_and_learning.ipynb): using satisfiability of LTN formulas as a training objective,
4. [Reasoning in LTN](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/logictensornetworks/logictensornetworks/blob/master/tutorials/4-reasoning.ipynb): measuring if a formula is the logical consequence of a knowledgebase.

The tutorials are implemented using jupyter notebooks.

### Examples

`examples/` contains a series of experiments. Their objective is to show how the language of Real Logic can be used to specify a number of tasks that involve learning from data and reasoning about logical knowledge. Examples of such tasks are: classification (`binary_classification`, `multiclass_classification`, `mnist`), regression, clustering, link prediction (`smokes_friends_cancer`, `parent_ancestor`).

The examples are presented with both jupyter notebooks and Python scripts.
